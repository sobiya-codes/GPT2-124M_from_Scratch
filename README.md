# ðŸš€ Large Language Model (LLM) from Scratch  

![LLM Training](lllm.gif)  

This repository provides a **step-by-step implementation of a Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch**, covering:  

- Data preparation  
- Model building  
- Pretraining  
- Fine-tuning  

It includes **notebooks and scripts** to help understand the complete process of training an LLM.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Stages  

### ðŸ”¹ Building an LLM  
- Data preparation & sampling  
- Attention mechanisms  
- Defining the LLM architecture  

### ðŸ”¹ Pretraining  
- Training the foundation model on large-scale text data  
- Learning word embeddings and transformer layers  

### ðŸ”¹ Fine-tuning  
- Using domain-specific datasets  
- Adapting the model for specialized tasks like **classification** or **chat assistants**  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Fine-tuned Model Applications  
- **Classifier** â†’ Trained using labeled data for tasks like spam detection.  
- **Assistant** â†’ Uses instruction tuning for conversational AI.  

---

## ðŸ›  Future Improvements  
- Add **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback)** fine-tuning.
